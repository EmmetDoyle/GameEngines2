# Game Engines 2 Assignment

## Walkthrough

5 fighters on each team attempt to seek towards a crystal in the middle of the scene. If they get too close to an enemy fighter, they will flee the fighter instead of seek the crystal. During this seeking and fleeing phase, one fighter will eventually hit the crystal. When that happends, the fighter stops seeking and fleeing and immediately retreats to their respecive mother ship. One of the mother ships has 6 patrolling ships in a triangle formation. The leader of this fleet follows a path of eight points around the mothership. The rest of the fleet follow the leader using offset pursuit.

There was framerate issues when attempting to record my screen so this was filmed on my phone instead.
